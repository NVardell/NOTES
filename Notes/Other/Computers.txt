* Monitors
    + Resolution (1080p < QHD < 4K)
        - Length x Width Format.
            * 1920 x 1080  (All the same thing.)
                - 1080p
                - Full HD
                - FHD
                - HD
            * 3440 x 1440
                - 2K
            * 3840 x 2160
                - 4K
                - Ultra HD
                - UHD
                - 2160p
        - Others
            * UFHD - UltraGear Full HD
        - LCD screens have a fixed quantity & size of display pixels.  Different size screens have different resolutions.
        - Recommended Resolution per Size
            * 17-19in = 1280*1024
            * 20-21in = 1600*1200
            * 22in Wide = 1680*1050
            * 23-28 Wide = 1920*1200
            * 30in Wide = 2560*1600 
    + Size
        - 109 ppi is the supposed 'sweet spot'.
    + Refresh Rates
        - # of times it updates per second.
        - Measured in hertz (Hz).
        - Higher it is, the smoother & less choppy it'll be.
        - Gamer minimum is 75Hz, but is expected to be around 144Hz.
    + Response Times
        - # of micro seconds to change a single pixel from black to white. (Or GTG. Gray-to-Gray.)
        - Gaming max = 5ms.  Should be around 0.5ms though.
    + Pixel Pitch (Pitch / Dot Pitch)
        - Describes the density of the pixels (LED clusters) on an LED display & correlates with resolution.
        - The distance in millimeters from the center of a pixel to the center of the adjacent pixel.
        - Reducing the distance between pixels (pixel pitch) without changing the screen size of the LCD increases the ppi, 
          and the higher this number, the higher the definition of the display. 
        - General guidelines
            * 0.28 - Entry Level (Pretty Bad)
            * 0.27-0.26 - Medium Range (Pretty Standard)
            * 0.25 - Lower = Pretty Great!
            * Goal is around .21 Horizontal & .24 Diagonal.
    + Panel Technologies
        - For Image Quality. TN = Fastest.  VA = Best Clarity.
        - Different types of screens use different types of panels.
            * OLED
                + Promise speeds, contrast, & color beyond anything currently!
                + Primary benefit is that each pixel can be individually controlled.
                    - This means true blacks instead of approximations, and makes everything more vibrant.
            * LCD
                + The LCD monitors primarily use five different panel types: 
                    1. TN (Twisted Nematic)
                        * Most common technology & also the oldest. 
                        * TN panel provides the shortest response times, making them good for gaming. 
                        * In combination with LED back-lighting, TN monitor offers high brightness & draw less 
                          power than competing technologies. However, its drawback is the color shifts that 
                          occur at wider viewing angles.
                    2. IPS (In-Plane Switching)
                        * Marks a breakthrough of LCD display. 
                        * IPS panel offers noticeably better color reproduction & keeps image colors 
                          consistent at virtually any angle, resulting in better viewing experience. 
                        * It has its own downside, such as slower response times & higher power consumption.
                    3. VA (Vertical Alignment)
                        * Combines the advantages of TN panel and IPS panel, offering good viewing angles
                          and generally better blacks and contrast than either TN or IPS panels. 
                        * Its weakness is the relatively low level of responsiveness, leading to more pronounced 
                          blurring during fast motion.
                    4. PVA (Patterned Vertical Alignment)
                        * Developed by Samsung as an alternative to MVA in the late 1990's. 
                        * It has many similar characteristics to VA panel, but has even better blacks and great contrast. 
                        * This panel type also offers large viewing angles and good color reproduction, 
                          though not as good as IPS panels. 
                        * It also has relatively low response time.
                    5. PLS (Plane to Line Switching)
                        * An "IPS-type" panel technology introduced by Samsung at the end of 2010.
                        * Designed to provide an alternative to the LGâ€™s popular IPS technology. 
                        * PLS panels sport viewing angles as wide as IPS, while offering higher brightness at a 
                          lower cost in power consumption.
                    6. TFT
    + Adaptive Sync Technology
        - Primarily aimed at eliminating screen tearing.
            * Screen tearing is when the video feed to the device is not in sync with the displays refresh rate.
                + Aka - The screen isn't able to keep up with the rate at witch it is receiving data.
        - Types
            * G-Sync (Nvidia)
            * FreeSync (AMD)
    + Curved?
        - 1800R curvature has a curved radius of 1800mm
            * Suggested best max viewing distance of 1.8 meters
        - Lower the curvature, the more curved the display is.
            * As low as 1000R, as of this year.
        - There are curved displays, whose curve is part of a circumference (arc). 
        - The smaller the radius, the larger the screen curve.
    + Display Colors
        - Describes how many colors can be displayed on a monitor's screen.
    + Brightness
        - Measured in candelas per square meter. (cd/m2)
        - The Luminance of the monitor, or how much light it projects.
        - Greater brightness often is associated with greateer percieved picture & clarity.
        - General ranges
            * 300 cd/m2 = Movies/Gaming 
            * 200+ cd/m2 = Everyday use
    + Contrast Ratio
        - Describes the difference between the brightest white and the darkest black that an LCD monitor can generate.
        - Two types (Can't compare the 2.)
            1. Dynamic - Measures bright white compared to darkest black.  Not necessarily at the same time or in the same scene.
            2. Static - Measures dark & light in a static shot, aka the highest contrast ratio achievable at the same time.
        - Higher the better. (Generally)
            * Will be able to distinguish between more colors.
    + Frame Rate Control (FRC)
        - Method which allows the pixels to show more color tones.
