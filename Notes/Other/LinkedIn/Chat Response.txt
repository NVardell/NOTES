Hey Charles,

Been out of the country, but I am back in the states now.
I am always happy to hear about new opportunities.  
Anytime later this week is perfectly fine. 
Feel free to reach me on my cell at 248-227-4714.

If I miss your call, feel free to shoot me a message or text, and I'll get back to you.

Kindest regards,
- Nate V.
