You must create a MongoDB user to access your cluster. For security purposes, Atlas requires clients to authenticate as MongoDB users to access clusters.

MongoDB users are separate from Atlas users:

MongoDB users can access databases hosted in Atlas.
Atlas users can log into Atlas but do not have access to MongoDB databases.

mongodb+srv://dbAdmin:<password>@royally-clustered-5htnk.mongodb.net/test

Replace <password> with the password for the dbAdmin user.
When entering your password, make sure that any special characters are URL encoded.
