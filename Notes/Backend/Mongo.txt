You must create a MongoDB user to access your cluster. For security purposes, Atlas requires clients to authenticate as MongoDB users to access clusters.

MongoDB users are separate from Atlas users:

MongoDB users can access databases hosted in Atlas.
Atlas users can log into Atlas but do not have access to MongoDB databases.
